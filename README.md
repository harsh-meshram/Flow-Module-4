# Smart Contract with Access Modifier

The programme/code exhibits smart contract access control through the creation of a structure that includes multiple modifiers for access.

## Description

The contract name is "SomeContract" which is a public. Then we will declare the four variables in a Struct named as "SomeStruct". 
The four variables and their properties are as follows:

pub(set) var a: This variable "a" can be read and modified inside the contract.
pub var b: This varibale "b" can be read but not modified outside the contract.
access(contract) var c: This variable "c" can be read inside the contract only.
access(self) var d: This contract "d" can be read inside the Struct only.

Then there are severeal Areas named as "Area 1, Area 2, Area 3, Area 4". In these Areas, different write and read properties are shown.


## Getting Started

2. Deploy the Smart Contract.
3. Execute Transation with apppropriate parameters.
4. Execute the Scipts.
